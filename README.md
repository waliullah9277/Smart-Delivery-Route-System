## Getting Started
# Smart Delivery Route Optimization and Load Balancing System
This project aims to optimize the delivery system of a logistics company. The
project will first compute the shortest delivery routes using Dijkstra’s
algorithm. The load balancing among vehicles will be handled using the
Knapsack algorithm to maximize efficiency. For connecting the main
warehouses, Kruskal’s or Prim’s algorithm will be used to minimize the cost of
transportation between them. The system will also have a dashboard to
visualize the optimal delivery routes and loads.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
